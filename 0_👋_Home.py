- üßë‚Äçüíª I am a Student at EAE Business School 

- üõ©Ô∏è prev: I am a certified software engineer specializing in Java. Over the past three years, I have worked at a mid-sized startup, marking my first job after graduating from college.
 While I have accumulated valuable experience in coding during this time, I am currently aiming to shift away from coding while retaining a technical focus. 
My current interest lies in becoming a Big Data Analyst, which is why I am pursuing another master's degree at EAE Business School.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è I am a technology enthusiast. My love for computers is all-encompassing‚ÄîI find joy in every aspect of them. 
From coding and debugging for eight to ten hours a day to engaging in discussions about coding practices with fellow programmers, computers are at the center of my professional life. 
Even outside the realm of programming, I extend my passion by teaching about computers at the primary school in my neighborhood .
The thrill of a new Linux kernel release or the availability of a groundbreaking web application for beta testing excites me to no end. 
Witnessing elegant and intelligent code solving complex problems is deeply impressive. 
It's during these moments that I believe we have only scratched the surface of what computers,data can achieve,
 and I'm driven to find simple solutions to the programming challenges I encounter.
